### Rules of RD Unconference

1. **Talk about RD Unconference**. Document and share your learnings from each session with the group. But do not discuss NDA content at unconference! It is a violation of your RD NDA to discuss confidential material learned earlier in the week at MVP or RD Summit outside of the forum from where it was delivered by a Microsoft employee.

2. **Collaborate** - Feel free to team up to form panels or joint presentations. Submit an "Issue" with your name(s) and topic recommendation through the RD Summit 2020 Unconference GitHub repo by 5:00PM PDT on March 12 to be considered.

3. **Vote for topics in the GitHub repo that interest you by 12:00PM PDT on March 19.** We'll hold as many sessions as time and facilities allow. The most popular topics will be assigned conference rooms, all others can spread out within the Reactor space.

4. **Present, ask questions, spark conversations, and be an interactive participant. No tourists** - We encourage everyone to participate in some way, shape, or form.

5. **Make space for others**. Everyone should feel heard, respected, and like they had the opportunity to contribute.

6. **Follow the Law of Two Feet**. If you aren't inspired by a session or don't feel you can contribute, feel free to leave and find a different session.

7. **Be flexible**. Sessions will go on as long as they have to or until they run into another session slot. Sessions are slated for 50 minutes each, but if the session only runs for 30 minutes, feel free to change topics or break early and join another session!
